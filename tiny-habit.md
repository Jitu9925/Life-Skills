## question 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
To develop a new habit break that habit into a tiny habit that is impossible to forget. Focus on changing behaviour rather than on outcome.<br>


## question 2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

* In the Tiny Habits method, B = MAP stands for Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt.
* Behavior (B): This is the new habit or behavior you want to establish.
* Motivation (M): It's crucial to choose habits that align with your values or goals.
* Ability (A): Your capability to perform the behavior.
* Prompt (P): the cue or trigger that reminds you to perform the behavior.<br>

## question 3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit) 
 
Celebrating success after each habit completion is vital because it reinforces the habit loop, boosts confidence, and motivates you to keep going. It creates "success momentum," accelerating habit development from small beginnings to more significant achievements. In short, celebrating small wins is a key factor in building and sustaining habits.br>

## question 4.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The "aggregation of marginal gains" philosophy is a concept that emphasizes the idea of making small, incremental improvements in various aspects of a process or system.This idea suggests that consistent, small improvements, even as modest as 1%, can lead to significant progress over time. 


## question 5.What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The core idea is to start with a behavior that is so small that it feels almost too easy to do.Attach your new tiny habit to an existing routine or habit. This helps in creating a trigger or prompt that reminds you to perform the new behavior.This makes it easier to stick to those habits because you feel like it's just part of who you are. In simple words, the book says changing your habits starts with changing how you think about yourself. <br>

## question 6.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
The book emphasizes initiating habits with tiny, easily achievable actions.Connecting new habits to established routines or activities makes them more likely to stick.Celebrating even minor successes reinforces positive associations with the habit, increasing motivation.Once a tiny habit is established, it can be gradually increased in complexity over time.

## question 7.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

* Introduce steps that require additional effort before engaging in the habit. 
* Reward should be unstatisfying and delayed

## question 8.Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

* I would like to develop a habit of meditation in the morning
* Start with a short duration. Initially, aim for just a few minutes of meditation to make it more manageable.
* Also, I will remind myself why  meditation is valuable, such as reducing stress or improving focus. <br>

## question 9.Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying? 

* I would like to reduce the usage of social media apps.
* Remove social media apps from the home screen of your phone or hide them in a folder.
* Turn off non-essential notifications to reduce the triggers that prompt you to check social media.
* Set a complex password for social media accounts to create a deliberate obstacle.
